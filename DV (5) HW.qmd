## Question 1

```{r}
wncaa |>
  filter(tourney_finish == "Champ") |>
  group_by(school) |>
summarise(number = n()) |>
  mutate(freq = number / sum(number), pct = round((freq*100), 0), 0) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = school, fill = pct)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
                    
  
```

What patterns do you see?

I see that a large majority of the schools are in between the 10 and 20 mark.

Who are the two teams that have won the most?

Tennessee and Uconn have won the most by far.

## Question 2

```{r}
champ_names <- unique(champs$school)
```
