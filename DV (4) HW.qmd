## Question 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the data 
tv_ratings <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaiseys/dav-course/main/Data/tv_ratings.csv")

# Glimpse the data 
glimpse(tv_ratings)
```

```{r}
tv_long <- tv_ratings %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  summarise(num_seasons = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(tv_ratings, by = "title") 

tv_long <- tv_long %>% 
  filter(num_seasons >= 5)
```

Use `tv_long` to make a line plot to trace how average ratings evolve across seasons. Remember to use the group aesthetic so that each line represents one show.

```{r}
tv_long |>
  ggplot(data = tv_long, mapping = aes(x = seasonNumber, y = av_rating, group = title)) + 
geom_line() +
  labs( x = "s", y = "s", title = "s")
```

It should look fairly messy. Can you draw any conclusions from it?
